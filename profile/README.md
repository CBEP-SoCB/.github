# Casco Bay Estuary Partnership State of Casco Bay Report Data Repositories

This collection of repositories is an archive of data and data analysis that support
Casco Bay Estuary Partnership (CBEP) "State of Casco Bay" report.

The primary purpose of the archive is to provide transparency with regards to data 
and data analyses used to conduct the State of Casco Bay review. A secondary purpose 
is to act as an archive of some of the methods used for analyses of locally 
available environmental data, to facilitate future projects.

This collection of repositories contains simplified versions of the data analysis
workflow used to produce the State of Casco Bay report.  We have simplified documentation 
of data sources; omitted code used to access, clean and transform source data; and been
selective about providing GIS files.  We have also removed many analyses that were not
reflected in the final State of Casco Bay report, such as models that confirm major 
findings or helped us select final models to present. 

A more complete archive of all analyses is available for review upon  request.
